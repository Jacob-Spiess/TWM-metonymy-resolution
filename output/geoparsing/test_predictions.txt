vacillated 0
about 0

the 0

it 0

increased 0
the 0
powers 0
of 0

The 0
main 0
piece 0
of 0
legislation 0
that 0
did 0
this 0
was 0
the 0

were 0
defined 0
by 0
the 0
apartheid 0

But 0
there 0
’s 0
ambiguity 0
around 0
what 0
powers 0
the 0
Act 0
actually 0
gives 0
chiefs 0
. 0

It 0
has 0
been 0
interpreted 0
as 0
giving 0
them 0

their 0
traditional 0
councils 0
powers 0
over 0
the 0

way 0

of 0
the 0

’ 0

over 0

Over 0

past 0
30 0
years 0
a 0
new 0
trend 0
began 0
to 0
evolve 0
. 0

Local 0

began 0
to 0
enter 0
into 0

with 0
mining 0
companies 0
on 0

of 0
rural 0
communities 0
on 0
the 0
platinum 0
belt 0
. 0

Chiefs 0
, 0
as 0
assumed 0

led 0

This 0
trend 0

some 0
have 0
labelled 0

to 0
realise 0
the 0

where 0
some 0
of 0

that 0
