have [Shape]xxxx 0

. [Shape]. 0

The [Shape]Xxx 0
Mexican [Shape]Xxxxx S-Associative
government [Shape]xxxx 0
has [Shape]xxx 0
worked [Shape]xxxx 0
to [Shape]xx 0
build [Shape]xxxx 0

On [Shape]Xx 0

, [Shape], 0
we [Shape]xx 0

made [Shape]xxxx 0

We [Shape]Xx 0

We [Shape]Xx 0
have [Shape]xxxx 0
never [Shape]xxxx 0
withheld [Shape]xxxx 0
our [Shape]xxx 0
cooperation [Shape]xxxx 0
, [Shape], 0
because [Shape]xxxx 0

, [Shape], 0

the [Shape]xxx 0

respecting [Shape]xxxx 0

The [Shape]Xxx 0
bilateral [Shape]xxxx 0

entails [Shape]xxxx 0
enormous [Shape]xxxx 0
opportunities [Shape]xxxx 0
that [Shape]xxxx 0

, [Shape], 0
which [Shape]xxxx 0

also [Shape]xxxx 0
poses [Shape]xxxx 0

Nevertheless [Shape]Xxxxx 0
, [Shape], 0
these [Shape]xxxx 0
will [Shape]xxxx 0

especially [Shape]xxxx 0
during [Shape]xxxx 0

, [Shape], 0
let [Shape]xxx 0

Italy [Shape]Xxxxx S-Associative

it [Shape]xx 0

Italy [Shape]Xxxxx S-Associative

always [Shape]xxxx 0

the [Shape]xxx 0

But [Shape]Xxx 0
this [Shape]xxxx 0

it [Shape]xx 0

In [Shape]Xx 0

Europe [Shape]Xxxxx S-Associative

In [Shape]Xx 0
essence [Shape]xxxx 0
, [Shape], 0
we [Shape]xx 0
can [Shape]xxx 0
now [Shape]xxx 0
officially [Shape]xxxx 0
acknowledge [Shape]xxxx 0
that [Shape]xxxx 0

However [Shape]Xxxxx 0

this [Shape]xxxx 0

Moreover [Shape]Xxxxx 0
